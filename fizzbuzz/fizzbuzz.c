    Your fizzbuzz implementation should initialize a counter, then
    iterate n times. If the ith iteration is divisible by 3, print
    "Fizz". If it's divisible by 5, print "Buzz". If it's divisible
    by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz". Increment the counter variable
    every time that nothing gets printed and return the counter.
    Don't forget to include newlines '\n' in your printf statements!
